Matthew Butterick wrote the best [website](https://practicaltypography.com) on the planet. 

It's a basic two-column website. It uses black and white, clean margins, and responds well on mobile. The most complex element in play is a floating `aside`. 

Yet it floors. 

Okay, maybe I exaggerated. Perhaps the best website award should go to Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell. They made [`EveryLayout`](https://every-layout.dev/), which also uses black and white, two columns, clean margins, and responsive themes. 

Perhaps we should ask for colour. Then I'd be tempted to nominate [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com), whose great innovation is the use of images, slight accents and subtle gradations.

No, wait -- [Asterisk Magazine](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/claude-finds-god)! How do you compete with a page that *looks* like a magazine spread?

What do all these disparate sites have in common? 

**They all use font effectively**.

# Typography is what you need

You can turn any website beautiful with a few rules:

1. Don't let the measure[^1] of your text exceed 60 characters. Between 45 to 75 is fine, but 60 ideal. 

```css
p {
    max-inline-size: 60ch
}
```

2. Let the line height[^2] be around 1.2 times the size of your font.

```css
p {
    line-height: 1.2
}
```

3. Differentiate your headings from text with margin and size

```css
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-size: 2rem
    margin-bottom: 2rem
}

p {
    margin-bottom: 1rem
}
```

4. Don't use the baseline 1 rem (unless you're on small screens). I myself use 1.25 (20px) to 1.5 rem (24 px) for base text. 

5. Use appropriate fonts. I chose to use the free serif font [`Lora`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora), but Matthew Butterick has a strong list of [recommendations](https://practicaltypography.com/font-recommendations.html).

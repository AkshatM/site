Every usecase under the sun, it seems, has a [ZKP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Zero-knowledge_proof) to solve it.

Google recently [open-sourced](https://github.com/google/longfellow-zk) a ZKP library. In their announcement, they describe a sample application:

> So, for example, a person visiting a website can verifiably prove he or she is over 18, without sharing anything else at all.[^1]

Zero-knowledge proofs could save us from AI slop:

> Moreover, the use of [ZKP] is accelerating due to the urgency with which identity credentials are needed ... to discern humans – and human-generated content – from machines and AI-generated content.[^2]

and avert phishing attempts:

> Imagine being able to login to websites without worrying about your password getting hacked[^3]

When will it cure cancer?

# Sometimes you _can_ trust things

I quite like ZKPs. They have their space in an engineer's arsenal.

But this breathless enthusiasm obscures a silly truth: sometimes it's overkill.

Zero-knowledge is about, well, zero trust. They're for when you _need_ to show sensitive information to a party you don't trust, when that party doesn't trust you, and the palace is full of spies.

However, as, it turns out, there's lots of cases where someone you both trust can just vouch for you instead:

1. Government-issued digital ID cards can confirm age.
2. Your hardware devices can attest your humanity for you.
3. Social logins and OAuth can solve passwordless logins.

All these options _attest_ to your ability to do something, or be something.

# Wait, what if I **need** to be anonymous?

Likely the reason ZKPs attract so much attention for these examples is the perceived _privacy_ benefit -- the idea that you don't need to be fingerprinted at all.

The foregoing solutions don't guarantee that. Nearly all of them might share a unique identifier about you -- your email, your IP address, or more.

This is important to avoid because fingerprinting enables tracking: somebody could follow you around from site to site, constructing a digital timeline of your activities.

Fret not. If you trust an attester but anonymity matters to you, **there is a solution**.

This weekend, I crammed [three](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9576.html) [IETF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9577.html) [RFCs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9578.html) in one go. Clocking in at seventy-five pages, it wasn't exactly light reading.

Taken together, they describe the Privacy Pass protocol, which promises a system where:

1. Your attesters can vouch for you, but not know what you're trying to do with those vouchers.
2. Services can accept the vouchers, but not necessarily know anything else about you.

I handle the orchestration, configuration, networking, transparency, reliability and development of distributed systems. Here's my [resume](./resume.pdf). 

My professional experience includes data pipeline development (Hbase, Zookeeper, Yarn); infrastructure automation (Packer, Salt, Terraform, CloudFormation), and orchestration platform development (Kubernetes, Spinnaker). Monitoring and observability are deep interests of mine. 

I like thinking about how low-level systems work (network protocols, ARP caches, eBPF, sysfs, ebtables, the use of Galois theory in RAID6 architecture); how high-level replication/consensus protocols work (Paxos, ZAB, Raft, 2PC); the history and theory of software engineering; and formal verification methods like TLA+.

My long-term career ambitions are to help design the next generation of distributed tooling (e.g. writing service meshes, L4 load balancers, distributed key-value stores, and orchestration software).

In my spare time, I play chess, read literature, do improv, learn Mandarin, and frequent museums as well as classical music concerts. 

I was originally trained as a physicist. I worked in a lot of labs as an undergraduate, mostly modeling climate change and Earthâ€™s radiation belts. I planned to work in condensed matter before realising I liked CS more.

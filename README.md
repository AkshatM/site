I handle the orchestration, configuration, networking, observability, reliability and development of distributed systems. Here's my [resume](./resume.pdf). 

I am interested in how low-level systems work (e.g. network protocols, eBPF, sysfs); how high-level replication/consensus protocols work (Paxos, ZAB, Raft, 2PC); the history and theory of software engineering; and formal verification methods like TLA+.

My long-term career ambitions are to help design the next generation of distributed tooling. Specifically, I seek to contribute to [cloud-native technologies](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/README.md#trail-map) e.g. writing service meshes, L4 load balancers, distributed key-value stores, and orchestration software.

In my spare time, I [play chess](https://lichess.org/@/CaptainAxe), read literature, do improv, learn Mandarin, visit  museums and attend classical music concerts. 

I was originally trained as a physicist. I worked in a lot of labs as an undergraduate, mostly modeling climate change and Earthâ€™s radiation belts. I planned to work in condensed matter before realising I liked CS more. You can read about some of my experiences with academia and research physics [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Akshat-Mahajan-1).
